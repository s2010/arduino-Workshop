/*
 Lesson: Ultrasonic Sensor 
 The following code reads from an ultrasonic sensor and returns the distance 
 to the closest object in range. It works by sending a pulse to the sensor
 to initiate the reading. Then, listens for any response coming from it.

const int trigPin = 8;    //This pin is used to initiate the reading from the sensor
const int echoPin = 7;    //This pin is used to read the distance from the sensor

}

void loop() {
  long duration, cm;  // define variables for storing the distance values


  // The ultrasonic sensor is triggered by a HIGH pulse of 2 or more microseconds.
  // Give a short LOW pulse beforehand to ensure a clean HIGH pulse:
  
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  
  // Now, after initiating the sensor to read the data, echoPin is used to read the signal from the ping
  // The pulse duration is the time elapsed (in microseconds) between sending a ping and receiving its reflection
  
  duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);

  // convert the time into a distance
  cm = microsecondsToCentimeters(duration);

  Serial.print(cm);

  // The speed of sound is 340 m/s or 29 microseconds per centimeter.
  // The ping travels out and back, so to find the distance of the object we take half of the distance travelled.
